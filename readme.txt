Change the post format on all posts in one category. Useful when you switch from styling "Asides" based on category to the new post formats.

== Description ==

Set Aside lets you change the post format on all posts in a category. This should come in useful e.g. when you used to run a theme that styles posts as "Asides" based on categories, and then you switch to a theme that styles them based on the post format, a feature which was introduced in WordPress 3.1

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `set-aside` folder to the `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the 'Tools' section where you will find the 'Set Aside' tool
